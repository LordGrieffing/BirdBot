I am hoping to build a robot that watches birds.

I want to put it all on a pi thats just watching a bird feeder.

Maybe it will record the types of birds it sees or something.


List of things I need to get:
- Raspberry pi 4
- PIR (motion) sensor
- Camera
- Sim Card
- Sim Card HAT for Pi
- Battery pack
- Solar panels

List of things I need to do:
- Program ROS2 node for sensor
- Figure out how to read PIR sensor data
- Decide what data I am keeping
- Program ROS2 service for data recording
- Figure out how to SSH into it using the SIM card
- design the case in on shape
- Print the case
- Figure out how to get the power bank to charge and power at the same time
